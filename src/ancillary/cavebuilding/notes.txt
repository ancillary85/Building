The tooltip that pops up to give the description for traits and tasks in the detail window can be banished by esc, so if it 
is showing, you have to hit esc twice to trigger the close button

-----------------------
should work on making instances of traitbuilder and whatnot, rather than static

-----------------------

entities being removed as a result
need new trait type, uncreate
don't remove an entity as a cost, only as a result
currently removes first entity with matching id
would like to select from appropriate targets
who should know? the task, the entity, the engine?

-----------------------
would like to split the menu that comes from a task needing to link with other entities.
currently, it is generated by finding the entities that each meet every requirement.
so, requiring light and psionic will allow a ghost, but not an archon.
Would be nice to split them in some way, so multiple different categories can be used, like duty officers.
For example, 3 foo, 5 bar. Something that is both foo and bar can be used for either, but only counts toward filling one category it is selected for.
It should be marked busy right away, so it doesn't show up as available for the other categories.

------------------------------
Get rid of fillTaskPaneBusy so that the logic is all in one place, and unmet requirements are always red

-----------------------------

Currently, only the entity doing the linking pays any costs. Also, only it gets costs refunded.

------------------------------
Room time, boys!
Figure out how you want the grid to grow
The engine should know about neighbors, validate that both rooms know about each other?
------------------------------
 FX id's are inconsistently applied by fxml and java

-------------------------------

ID's should switch to StringProperties so changed can be watched?

-------------------------------

Switch Lists to Sets?

-------------------------------

Load more into the entity and room buttons, holding their listeners and whatnot?

------------------------------

Room cancel task button has weird background

Adding and removing rooms by tasks

Make roombuilder instead of reflection using method names in trait descriptions?

Let's make a dedicated room listener field in the room to be told when it changes?

Tasks getting added over and over again with AntBuilder.makeEntity when given multiple IDs

Would like Tasks display order to be a thing
