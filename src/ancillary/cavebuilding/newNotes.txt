Want to handle both predefined and arbitray actives. Currently, Rooms and ActiveEntities are both Active. This allows 
Rooms to have Tasks and behave similarly to the ActiveEntities. Rooms should possibly implement another interface
called "Location" for their x and y positions, neighbors, etc. Entity currently has id, name, and traits.

I am presently making ActiveEntities through both arbitrary means builders. Let's standardize the builders better.
The Engine can maintain the various builders (AntBuilder, GoblinBuilder, etc) and ask them for a relevant entity. A builder
just for arbitraty ActiveEntities may be needed.

-How to tell the Engine what builder to use? I say I want a Worker Ant. The Ant should know identifying info for the builder 
to use? A Builder id String, that the Engine can use to pick a Builder. Then, ask the builder for something with the Ant's info.
Need to add builderID number or String to ActiveEntities

So, I can ask the Engine to use the Builder with id "foo" to make a "baz," which could be very different from asking 
Builder "bar" for a "baz." 

-How to handle naming? Can specify a name when asking the Builder for something. Ask the Builder's Namer what to do
in case of duplicate names?
    
-Should we use some queue of events to process at turn end? The Engine would update and pass relevant results to some 
turn-end-summary helper class. This helper class could help evaluate things, or it might just organize things for the Controller
to go through and report on. This could be a way to handle GameEvents.
    Should it evaluate anything on its own? I think not; it can just be for storage and organizing. 

-I'd like GameEvents that can be brought up at end of turn, start of turn, in response to actions, when certain conditions are met, etc.
A thing can have a GameEvent as a Result Trait, and that GameEvent can be stored.

Example: Display "The queen is worried about running out of food!" when food supply first hits 1 or less. This could be generated
at the start, and wait for its condition to be met, then it tells the controller it is ready to go. The controller chooses what to do with it.
In order for this to have its conditions evaluated appropriately, they would have to be checked in response to anything that 
alters the food count. I think that such a thing would be fine as a end/start of turn thing. Like, the warning pop ups in response to 
the update, and interrupts it. In this way, it could be an "Are you sure?" sort of message. Most other things can be tied to the 
Tasks that started them, as messages when begun/finished.
